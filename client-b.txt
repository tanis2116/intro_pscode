Create a variable to store the location in the warehouse that is to be found
Figure out where the person currently is
Guide them to the furthest southwest corner to begin the search
Begin the walk north, tracking the path and comparing it to the variable of the location
If the current location and the variable match, print “Stop, you’re there!” if not match, continue to the furthest north corner
Shift the walker to the right one increment and begin south
If the current location and the variable match, print “stop you’re there!”
Repeat the shift, walk north, shift, walk south until the walker is either at the variable point or reaches the furthest southeast corner.
